## Flashing Creator App – Undo/Redo & Handle Bug Context (for AI)

**Stack:**  
- React + Vite + TypeScript  
- Zustand for state  
- react-konva for 2D canvas  
- Tailwind CSS for UI

**Key Features:**  
- Draw polylines and freehand lines.
- Each line is an array of points, stored in Zustand (`lines`).
- While drawing a polyline, points are in `polyPoints`.
- Handles (draggable circles) are shown for each point of each finished line.

**Undo/Redo Logic:**  
- While drawing a polyline: Undo removes the last point from `polyPoints`.
- After finishing: Undo removes the last point from the last finished line in `lines`. If only one point remains, the whole line is removed.
- Redo is available for finished lines (using Zustand’s `future` stack).

**Handles/Circles Bug:**  
- Handles are rendered based on `linesState`, which is synced to `lines` in a `useEffect`.
- When all lines are removed, `linesState` is set to `[]`.
- Dragging or updating handles is disabled if there are no lines.
- **Bug:** Sometimes, after undoing all lines, handles/circles may still appear. This is a known issue.

**How to Resume:**  
- All main logic is in App.tsx.
- If you want to continue, check the sync between `lines`, `linesState`, and the rendering of handles in Canvas2D.tsx.
- The bug is likely a race condition or stale state between `lines` and `linesState`.
